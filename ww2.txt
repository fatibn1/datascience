World War II (WWII or WW2) was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. 
It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.
The war in Europe began on 1 September 1939, when Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. 
Britain and France responded by declaring war on Germany on 3 September. 
The war in the Pacific began on 7 December 1941, when Japan attacked the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor.

During the war, the Holocaust resulted in the genocide of six million Jews. 
The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as the world's two superpowers, leading to the Cold War.
The war ended with the unconditional surrender of Germany on 8 May 1945 (V-E Day) and Japan on 2 September 1945 (V-J Day), following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

WWII had a profound impact on the world, leading to the creation of the United Nations and a restructured international order.
